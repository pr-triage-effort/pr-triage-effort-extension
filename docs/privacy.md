# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

## Data Collection

We do not collect usage data. Our extension only stores the following information in cookies:

- **Personal Access Token**: Provided by the user.
- **Repository Variable**: Provided by the user.

## Data Usage

- **Personal Access Token**: Used to authenticate with GitHub to access the necessary resources for sorting and prioritizing pull requests.
- **Repository Variable**: Used to overwrite the default repository the extension obtains the GitHub Actions Artifact from (if the analysis was performed outside of the targetted repository). 

## Data Protection

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data. The Personal Access Token and repository variable are stored locally in cookies and are not transmitted to any external servers.
